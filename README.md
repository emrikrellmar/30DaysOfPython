# 30 Days of Python Challenge by Asabeneh
This is a challenge created by Asabeneh to learn Python in 30 days using the repository 30-Days-Of-Python.
Asabeneh goes through everything from the basics, such as environment setup, variables, and data types, to more advanced topics like web scraping, APIs, and data analysis.
Every day focuses on a new concept, function, or module, and also includes practical exercises for you to strengthen your understanding. Wich i document in this repository.

## Structure
The challenge is divided into 30 days:

Days 1–10: Python basics: syntax, variables, strings, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

Days 11–20: Functions, higher-order functions, modules, exceptions, file handling, and regular expressions.

Days 21–30: Advanced topics: classes and objects, web scraping, working with APIs, data analysis with pandas, and building small projects.

## My Goal
The purpose of this repository is to document my learning journey through the challenge.
I will be uploading my solutions and notes for each day as I progress, to track my growth and share what I’ve learned.
